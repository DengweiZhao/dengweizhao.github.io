I'm now a post-doctor from [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn). My research interest includes heuristic search, AlphaZero-like optimization, and reinforcement learning.

I obtained my B.Sc. and Ph.D. from School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), in 2019 and 2025, respectively, under the supervision of Professor [Lei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rN2ny9kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Associate Professor [Shikui Tu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~tushikui/).
