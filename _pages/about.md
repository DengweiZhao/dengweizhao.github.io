I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn). My research interests lie in heuristic search, AlphaZero-inspired optimization, and reinforcement learning. I received my B.Sc. (2019) and Ph.D. (2025) degrees in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Professor [Lei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rN2ny9kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Associate Professor [Shikui Tu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~tushikui/). I am currently seeking faculty or research positions. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in potential collaborations or opportunities.

You can find my CV [here](../../Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
